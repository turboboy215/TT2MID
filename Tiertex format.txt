The Frequency Table
=======================================
A standard frequency table is found with the following instructions:

ld hl, note_table
add a
add l
ld l, a
adc h
sub l

In hex, this equates to:
21 F7 ?? ?? 85 6F 8C 95

Macro/Sequence Pointers
=======================================
Following the frequency table is a series of four 16-bit pointers denoting the location of each song's "macros", which represent channels of a song (see below).

Song Control
=======================================
After the pointers to each song is a "control" list, each consisting of four bytes each. The format represents as follows:
1. Volume
2. Position (Panning?)
3. Sounds on
4. Unused (marked as "UNKOWN (Future development")

These always seem to be set to $FF, $FF, $8F, $00.

Channel 4 Instrument Table
=======================================
Next is the instrument table for data concerning channel 4 (noise channel)'s instruments. These are all a series of 24-bit pointers which are described as follows:
"first byte = freq (ish)
second byte = vol 0-F/ env...... 1 to 7 goes down ... 8 to f goes up
third byte = max time ........ 63 = shortest ...... 00 = longest
                 bit 6 = "continuous" 1: on, 0: off"

Instrument Table
=======================================
After this is an "envelope table" which has 16-bit (data word) definitions of the pointers for each instrument on all channels. Since most instruments are unused, much of the space is filled with empty values.

Channel 1/2 Instrument Format
=======================================
Next is the data representing each of channel 1 and 2 (pulse)'s instruments. Each byte is mapped as follows:
1 = Number of sections (in bytes) for vibrato
2-3 =  ?
4 = ?
4-6 = Envelopes/volume change pattern
7+ = Vibrato/frequency change pattern (Number of bytes this takes is specified in 1)

Channel 3 Instrument Format
=======================================
After channel 4 and 1/2 come the channel 3 (wave) instrument data, including the waveforms used themselves. These use the following format:
1 = Number of sections (in bytes) for vibrato
2-17 = The waveform to be loaded into wave RAM
18+ = Vibrato/frequency change pattern (Number of bytes this takes is specified in 1)

The Sequence Headers (Macros)
=======================================
Representing each sequence is a small "macro", which is a list giving parameters and pointers to each sequence.
For channels 1-3, these begin with the instrument ID (one byte). Then, any of the following commands are used for a sequence:
$F8 = End macro
$F9 xx xx xx xx xx = Start macro, # of times to play, transpose value, pointer to the actual sequence itself
$FC xx = Loop point, # of times to play
$FD = End of loop
$FE = Stop song (for non-looping tunes)
$FF = Restart song (if loop point specified, restart there, otherwise beginning)

The Sequence Format
=======================================
Note values are 16-bit, in the following format:

11 22
1 = Note (Same as standard MIDI note values)
2 = Length (MIDI length divided by 5)

As stated in the macro header, $F8 denotes the end of a sequence.
